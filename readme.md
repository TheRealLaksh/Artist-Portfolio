# The Digital Canvas: An Artist Portfolio Template

Every artist needs a stage. A quiet gallery. A space to share their work with the world. This project was born from that idea—to create a digital canvas that feels as alive and dynamic as the art it holds.

It’s a place for stories, for collections, for performances. A minimal, modern, and interactive home for your creative work.

### Core Philosophy

* **A Fluid Experience:** Navigate through galleries and stories without interruption. The entire site is a single, continuous space, designed to keep the focus on the work.
* **An Interactive Atmosphere:** The background subtly shifts and responds to you, creating an environment that feels present and alive.
* **Your Art, On Any Screen:** From a phone to a desktop, your work is presented beautifully, just as you intended.

### The Medium (Tech Stack)

* HTML5 & CSS3
* **Tailwind CSS** for clean, utility-first styling.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** for a fast, lightweight experience.
* **Particles.js** for the living, interactive background.

### Make It Your Own

To use this template for your own portfolio:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [git clone https://github.com/TheRealLaksh/Shruti-Misra.git]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the folder and open `index.html`** in your browser to see it live.
3.  **Customize:**
    * Replace the images in the `/assets/images/` folder with your own.
    * Update the video files in `/assets/videos/`.
    * Edit the text in the `.html` files in the `/pages/` directory to tell your own story.
