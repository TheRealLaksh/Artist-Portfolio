            <strong>Actor's Notes:</strong> When I found out that I was chosen as a speaker for the TED -Ed event, I was
            elated, but then the dreaded question dawned upon me. What is your topic?! I was quite confused. I wrote a
            draft and then proceeded to completely reject the idea. And then I kept coming up with new ideas, sometimes
            humorous, sometimes quite engaging, but none that I genuinely connected with.
            And then it struck me, if I want a talk that connects with me as well as my audience, I should talk about
            myself. And that is exactly what I did.

            I talked about this horrible blunder I had made on my board exam and used poker as a metaphor for life and
            its unpredictability. I was quite nervous initially, but I started working with my talk. I got inputs from
            many mentors, teachers and friends. After a lot of work, I finally finished writing it. Then came the
            toughest part, execution. I started memorizing it and practicing. I would suddenly forget the first line of
            my speech sometimes. I would become scared and go blank. I stayed up for a week every single night in front
            of a mirror practicing my speech. And the day finally arrived, I was up there on stage, with everyone
            looking up at me.I spoke for a solid 10 minutes and I had done it!
            I pushed myself beyond my comfort zone and put myself out there. Expressing my ideas and thoughts to the
            world around.
